                      AmaroK XUL Remote 0.4
==================================================================

Control AmaroK from any Firefox browser on your network.

the script itself is a xml-rpc server which acts as a gateway 
between amarok and the included firefox extension.


INSTALL:
- Download the archive, then install and run it with AmaroK script manager
- with firefox, go to http://hostname:8888 , and install the extension
- restart firefox
- launch "AmaroK remote" in the firefox "Tools" menu.
- the extension has 2 options: host and port, that's the same host (hostname) and port (8888)
	you used to install the extension.
