                      AmaroK XUL Remote 0.6
==================================================================

Control AmaroK from any Firefox browser on your network.

the script itself is a HTTP server which plugs amarok DCOP interface 
to the included firefox extension.


INSTALL:
- Download the archive, then install and run it with AmaroK script manager
- with firefox, go to http://hostname:8888 , and install the extension
- restart firefox
- launch "AmaroK remote" in the firefox "Tools" menu.
- the extension has 2 options: host and port, that's the same host (hostname) and port (8888)
	you used to install the extension.

TODO

(much) later:
- use remote XUL instead of an extension (custom treeviews don't work remotely yet)
