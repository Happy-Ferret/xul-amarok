and install the extension. (where host is the host running the script)

Then restart Firefox and launch the extension via the Tools menu.

The following features are working:
- basic player manipulation: play, pause, stop, next, previous, seek, volume
- playlist view, plays a track when clicking on it
- collection browser with filtering, drag and drop tracks to the playlist
- a switch for enabling party mode

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- python 2.3
- pydcop (python DCOP bindings) python-dcop package on Debian, libkdec1 on Mandrake
- AmaroK 1.2.3
- Firefox 1.x (tested on 1.5 beta1)

TODO
----
- remove tracks from playlist: no DCOP call to do this yet
- drag and drop albums and artists
- context browser
- make distinction between compilations and albums in the collection browser

This script is a XML-RPC server, it talks with the extension via XML-RPC, and with AmaroK via DCOP.
It also serves the Firefox extension when receiving a HTTP GET request.
